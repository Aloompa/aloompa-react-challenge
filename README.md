# Aloompa React Challenge

## Setup

- In `index.tsx`, hook up your API to the Apollo client.
- In `app.tsx`, write a query to list all the events in the original app with the fields `id`, `name`, `image`, and `description` and hook up the response to the `events` variable.
- Run `yarn` or `npm i` in the project and then `yarn start` or `npm start` to make sure the data is querying and displaying properly.
